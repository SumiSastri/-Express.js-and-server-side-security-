**Server-Side Injection** is the activity of injecting untrusted data into the server as part of a command or a query. With this injected code the attacker can trick the server to do all sorts of no good. The attacker typically will use eval, set timeout, set interval, and function methods to process malicious code. For example, an attacker could inject a do while conditional into an eval function, therefore rendering the server useless by using 100% of its resources. Leveraging eval's weaknesses, the attacker could also insert commands to read the content of a response call to a known server and therefore be able to pull user data.

To minimize service-side injections, you wanna do the following: Always validate and sanitize user input as we've mentioned many times in this course. Never use eval, setTimeout, and setInterval and function to parse user input. Use JSON.parse when you need to parse user input. Or for type conversion, use the safer parse methods, like parse integer, parse-float for example. Include use strict in your code. So these are best practices to minimize injections. Make sure you do them.
